# About page

I live in Uppsala, Sweden with my wife and our 11-year-old son. I began my career as an electrician and then moved into managing warehouse and stock for a wholesale company.

After obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, I took on roles that combined logistics, warehouse management, and engineering tasks. This was followed by a position as a development engineer, where among other accomplishments, I contributed to a patent.

I'm currently expanding my knowledge in the field of Machine Learning and Image Analysis. Connect with me on LinkedIn:
